About
-----
Mock Interview App is intended to help hiring teams and candidates simulate real technical interviews, track performance, and store feedback. This README provides setup and maintenance instructions; adjust sections to match your repository structure and implementation details.

Features
--------
- Create and manage mock interview events
- Question bank (coding, system design, behavioral)
- Scheduling with time zones
- Interviewer feedback forms and scoring
- Candidate progress/history dashboard
- (Optional) Video/audio recording and playback
- (Optional) Scoring and analytics

Tech Stack
----------
Replace or update this list to reflect your project's actual stack:
- Frontend: React / Next.js / Vue
- Backend: Node.js + Express / NestJS / Django / Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / MySQL
- Authentication: JWT / OAuth / Auth0
- Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / Heroku / Docker / Kubernetes

Repository Structure
--------------------
Adjust paths to match your repository:
- /frontend — UI client (React)
- /backend — API server (Node/Express)
- /scripts — helper scripts and utilities
- /docs — additional documentation
- /tests — test suites

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g., 18+)
- npm or yarn
- A database (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) if the app requires one
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose for containerized development

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root or in the respective service directories (frontend/backend) with entries like:

# Backend (.env)
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mock_interview
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_here
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend (.env)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

Install
-------
From the repository root, install dependencies for each service.

Example for a two-folder (frontend/backend) structure:

- Backend
  ```
  cd backend
  npm install
  ```
- Frontend
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

Run (Development)
-----------------
Start services locally:

- Backend (example)
  ```
  cd backend
  npm run dev
  # or
  NODE_ENV=development npm run start:dev
  ```

- Frontend (example)
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm run dev
  # Next.js default: http://localhost:3000
  ```

If using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Build (Production)
------------------
- Backend
  ```
  cd backend
  npm run build
  npm start
  ```

- Frontend
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm run build
  npm run start
  ```

Testing
-------
Run unit and integration tests:

- Backend
  ```
  cd backend
  npm test
  ```

- Frontend
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```

Add more details about test coverage and CI configuration (GitHub Actions) here.

Deployment
----------
Describe how to deploy the app — e.g., push to GitHub, use Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Heroku/DigitalOcean for backend, or provide Docker image and Kubernetes manifests.

Contributing
------------
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature
3. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Add my feature"
4. Push to your fork: git push origin feature/my-feature
5. Open a Pull Request explaining your changes

Please add tests and update documentation where appropriate. Follow the project's coding style and run linters before submitting.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If migrations fail, make sure DATABASE_URL is correct and database user has required permissions.
- If frontend cannot reach backend, confirm NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and CORS settings.
- Check logs: backend logs and browser console for errors.

Roadmap
-------
Planned improvements (examples — update to reflect your priorities):
- Integrated video recording + playback
- Real-time collaboration / shared whiteboard
- Interview analytics & reporting dashboard
- Candidate skill-tracking and suggested resources
